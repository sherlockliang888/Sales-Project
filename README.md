# Sales-Project
<p> This is a Python based data analytics project, which focus on data collection, data cleaning as well as data malnipulation. </p>
<p> The goal for this project is to look at the sales data, which contains information of the product, quantity, price, order date and etc. My job is to clean the data I have, discover some interesting sales results and provide some tips regarding marketing. </p>
<p> I will first read all csv files from a folder and concatenate them into one single csv file. I will make sure that there is no missing or invalid data. Then I will answer the following questions: </p>
<ul>
  <li> Which month has the best sale? </li>
  <li> Which city has the best sale? </li>
  <li> What time should we display advertisements to maximize likelihood of buying? </li>
  <li> What products are most often sold together? </li>
 </ul>
